# 1. Breeding & Incident Management

**Status Classification:**  
For pets that pass away during the breeding process, update the status to "Deceased" rather than just "Dead." This provides a more professional and sensitive classification in the records.

**Comprehensive Logging:**  
Ensure the system allows for all incidents (medical, behavioral, or accidental) to be recorded during breeding sessions. Nothing should be left off the record.

# 2. Medical & Vaccination Protocols

**Rabies Administration:**  
**Constraint:** The system must prevent Rabies vaccine entries for animals younger than 3 months (12 weeks).  
**Note:** This is a critical safety and regulatory standard to ensure the vaccine is effective and safe for the puppy/kitten.

**Parasite Control:**  
Include fields or categories for common treatments like NexGard (flea/tick preventives) to track routine wellness beyond just vaccines.

**Dosage Consideration (Feedback from Ma'am Marj):**  
The vaccination dosage/shot may vary depending on the size of the pet. We need to evaluate how the system will handle these size-based differences and whether specific parameters should be added to ensure accurate administration.

# 3. AI & Dataset Enhancements

**Inclusivity (Aspin/Puspin):**  
The AI must be trained to recognize and include Aspin (Askal) and Puspin (Puskal). These are the most common breeds in the Philippines and are essential for local accuracy.

**Data Training:**  
There is a need to "train more on datasets." This means increasing the variety of images—different lighting, angles, and coat colors—to improve the AI’s recognition reliability.
