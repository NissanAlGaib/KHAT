# Consultation Feedback
**Date:** February 13, 2025

## Core Functionality Issues

### Animal/Human Recognition
- Implement validation to distinguish between animal and human profiles in the system.
- Add verification mechanism for text-based entries (prevent owners from entering arbitrary/false information).
- Consider how to validate user inputs when they can simply type anything.

## User Account Management
- **Implement a warning/reason system before account suspension** (don't suspend immediately).
- Add user rating system for loyal and successful users.
- Create a "Top Users" feature to highlight active/reliable members.

## Admin & Security Features

### Multi-Admin System
- Add support for multiple admin accounts.
- Implement activity logging to track which admin performed which actions (CRUD operations).
- Ensure accountability - must be able to identify who made changes in case of errors.
- Create viewable logs for all admin activities.

## Dashboard Improvements
- Add date filtering/display functionality.
- Improve the visual presentation when clicking on pictures (current display is not user-friendly).

## Reports & Analytics ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **Missing Reports Feature** - Systems without reports are essentially useless.
- Monthly vaccination statistics (e.g., "How many animals were vaccinated this month?").
- Breeding interest reports by location (e.g., "How many users want to breed in specific areas?").
- General analytics and data visualization capabilities.

## Administrative Controls

### Subscription Management
- Create interface to edit subscription tiers and pricing.
- Enable admins to manually grant subscriptions to specific users.
- Ensure pricing can be updated when market changes occur.

### Protocol Types
- Make protocol types editable/expandable (allow for future additions of new protocol categories).

## Technical Requirements

### Testing & Quality Assurance ⚠️ IMPORTANT
- Thoroughly test for and fix all server errors before deployment.
- Conduct comprehensive system testing.
